Data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that Black women are 3 to 4 times likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than White women. The proposed Maternal CARE Act is gaining national attention as it attempts to address racial disparities in maternity care and support efforts by states to eliminate maternal mortality and morbidity as well as racial disparities in maternal healthcare. The proposed bill seeks grants to fund (1) implicit bias training for healthcare providers and (2) demonstration projects for the Pregnancy Home Medical Program.

Our team will attempt to investigate the following question: Are racial disparities in pregnancy-related deaths primarily the result of implicit bias or are they the result of attempts to address other health factors such as hypertension and diabetes during pregnancies?

We will gather and analyze 2009-2016 vital statistics data from the CDC related to natality, maternal race, maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal health risk factors, and method of delivery (e.g. vaginal vs. cesarean). In addition, we will attempt to determine through multiple data visualizations whether racial disparities can be eliminated once risk factors and methods of delivery are considered.
